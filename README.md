# Ensemble_Reg

The study describes the application of the prediction of educational indicators in the Brazilian scenario through ensemble models. The first model was developed by combining parametric regression techniques with base-level learners. The second model uses the set of methods found in the literature in a Stacking regression application formed by parametric and non-parametric techniques.
